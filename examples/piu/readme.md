# Moddable SDK - Piu Examples

Copyright 2020 Moddable Tech, Inc.<BR>
Revised: September 28, 2020

These examples demonstrate how to use features of the [Piu user interface framework](../../documentation/piu/piu.md). Piu is an object-based framework that makes it easier to create complex, responsive layouts.

Most of the examples are designed for a QVGA (320x240) screen, but many feature responsive layouts that work on a variety of screen sizes. All of the examples in this folder run on the desktop simulator with the exception of the `one-line` and `one-line-keyboard` examples.

This document provides a brief description of each example and a preview of each app running on the desktop simulator. If you are looking for an example that demonstrates how to use a specific feature, see the list below. Keep in mind that this list provides only a few recommendations and is not a complete list of examples that use each feature.
