 	Adafruit Bluefruit LE Friend UART service
 	https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-ble-bluetooth-low-energy-friend/uart-service
	https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-ble-bluetooth-low-energy-friend/terminal-settings
 
 	To use this application, first set the BLEFriend for UART mode and connect with a serial terminal @ 9600,8,N,1.
 	Strings written to the RX characteristic display in the terminal, and strings sent from
 	the terminal arrive as TX notifications and are traced to the console.
