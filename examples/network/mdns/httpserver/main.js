	This example claims the local name "example". It provides an HTTP server that can be
	acccessed at "http://example.local/" from a web browser on any computer or mobile device

 	If the name "example" is already claimed on the current network, a unique name with be
 	found by appending "-2" or "-3", etc. to the requested name.

 	The name selected is output to the console. The MDNS constructor provides an optional
	callback to report the selected name to the host application.
