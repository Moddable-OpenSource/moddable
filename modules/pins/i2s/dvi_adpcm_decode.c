/*
** Intel/DVI ADPCM coder/decoder.
**
** The algorithm for this coder was taken from the IMA Compatability Project
** proceedings, Vol 2, Number 2; May 1992.
**
** Version 1.2, 18-Dec-92.
**
** Change log:
** - Fixed a stupid bug, where the delta was computed as
**   stepsize*code/4 in stead of stepsize*(code+0.5)/4.
** - There was an off-by-one error causing it to pick
**   an incorrect delta once in a blue moon.
** - The NODIVMUL define has been removed. Computations are now always done
**   using shifts, adds and subtracts. It turned out that, because the standard
**   is defined using shift/add/subtract, you needed bits of fixup code
**   (because the div/mul simulation using shift/add/sub made some rounding
**   errors that real div/mul don't make) and all together the resultant code
**   ran slower than just using the shifts all the time.
** - Changed some of the variable names to be more meaningful.
