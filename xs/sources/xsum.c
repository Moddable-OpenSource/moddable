/* ---------------------- IMPLEMENTATION ASSUMPTIONS ----------------------- */

/* This code makes the following assumptions:

     o The 'double' type is a IEEE-754 standard 64-bit floating-point value.

     o The 'int64_t' and 'uint64_t' types exist, for 64-bit signed and
       unsigned integers.

     o The 'endianness' of 'double' and 64-bit integers is consistent
       between these types - that is, looking at the bits of a 'double'
       value as an 64-bit integer will have the expected result.

     o Right shifts of a signed operand produce the results expected for
       a two's complement representation.

     o Rounding should be done in the "round to nearest, ties to even" mode.
