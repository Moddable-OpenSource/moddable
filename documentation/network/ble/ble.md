## Adding BLE to a Project
The BLE client and server are implemented as separate modules to accomodate the limited memory and storage available on embedded devices. BLE applications instantiate a BLE client or BLE server, but never both.

Pre-made manifests are available for the BLE client and BLE server. Add them to the `include` array of your application's manifest to use them in your project.

To add the BLE client to a project:

	"include": [
		/* other includes here */
		"$(MODDABLE)/modules/network/ble/manifest_client.json",
	],
	
To add the BLE server to a project:

	"include": [
		/* other includes here */
		"$(MODDABLE)/modules/network/ble/manifest_server.json",
	],

<a id="usingble"></a>
## Using BLE

BLE applications typically subclass `BLEClient` or `BLEServer` and then add device and/or application specific code. The following BLE client example subclasses `BLEClient` to scan for and discover peripherals:

```javascript
import BLEClient from "bleclient";

class Scanner extends BLEClient {
	onReady() {
		this.startScanning();
	}
	onDiscovered(device) {
		let scanResponse = device.scanResponse;
		let completeName = scanResponse.completeName;
		if (completeName)
			trace(completeName + "\n");
	}
}
	
let scanner = new Scanner;
```

The following BLE server example subclasses `BLEServer` to advertise the device as a BLE Health Thermometer peripheral:

```javascript
import BLEServer from "bleserver";
import {uuid} from "btutils";
	
class HealthThermometerService extends BLEServer {
	onReady() {
		this.startAdvertising({
			advertisingData: {flags: 6, completeName: "Moddable HTM", completeUUID16List: [uuid`1809`, uuid`180F`]}
		});
	}
}
	
let htm = new HealthThermometerService;
```

<a id="bleclient"></a>
## BLE Client
A BLE client can connect to one or more BLE peripherals. The maximum number of concurrent connections is defined at build time and ultimately limited by what the underlying embedded platform supports. To override the default maximum of two connections, override the `max_connections` value in the manifest `defines` section:

	"defines": {
		"ble": {
			"max_connections": 3
		}
	},

A BLE client typically performs the following steps to receive notifications from a BLE peripheral:

1. Start scanning for peripherals
2. Find the peripheral of interest by matching the advertised complete name or UUID(s) in the scan response
3. Establish a connection with the peripheral
4. Discover the primary service(s) of interest
5. Discover the characteristic(s) within the service(s) of interest
6. Enable notifications for characteristic(s) of interest

The following code from the [powermate](../../../examples/network/ble/powermate) example app shows a typical client flow:

```javascript
const DEVICE_NAME = 'PowerMate Bluetooth';
const SERVICE_UUID = uuid`25598CF7-4240-40A6-9910-080F19F91EBC`;
const CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = uuid`9CF53570-DDD9-47F3-BA63-09ACEFC60415`;

class PowerMate extends BLEClient {
	onReady() {
		this.startScanning();
	}
	onDiscovered(device) {
		if (DEVICE_NAME == device.scanResponse.completeName) {
			this.stopScanning();
			this.connect(device);
		}
	}
	onConnected(device) {
		device.discoverPrimaryService(SERVICE_UUID);
	}
	onServices(services) {
		let service = services.find(service => service.uuid.equals(SERVICE_UUID));
		if (service)
			service.discoverCharacteristic(CHARACTERISTIC_UUID);
	}
	onCharacteristics(characteristics) {
		let characteristic = characteristics.find(characteristic => characteristic.uuid.equals(CHARACTERISTIC_UUID));
		if (characteristic)
			characteristic.enableNotifications();
	}
	onCharacteristicNotification(characteristic, buffer) {
		let value = new Uint8Array(buffer)[0];
		trace(`value: ${value}\n`);
	}
}
```

A BLE client is fundamentally asynchronous and results are always delivered to the `BLEClient` class callback methods, e.g. `onReady`, `onConnected`, etc. above. The following sections describe the BLE client classes, properties, and callbacks.

<a id="classbleclient"></a>
## Class BLEClient

The `BLEClient` class provides access to the BLE client features.

```javascript
import BLEClient from "bleclient";
```

### Functions

#### `onReady()`

Applications must wait for the `onReady` callback before calling other `BLEClient` functions:

```javascript
class Client extends BLEClient {
	onReady() {
		/* stack is ready to use */
	}
}
let client = new BLEClient;
```

***

#### `startScanning([params])`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `params` | `object` | Object containing scan properties.

The `params` object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `active` | `boolean` | Set `true` for active scanning, `false` for passing scanning. Default is `true`.
| `duplicates` | `boolean` | Set `true` to receive all advertising packets, `false` to filter out multiple advertising packets received from the same peripheral device. Default is `true`.
| `filterPolicy` | `number` | Filter policy applied to scan. Default is `GAP.ScanFilterPolicy.NONE` (no filtering). Refer to the [BLE whitelisting](#blewhitelisting) section for details.
| `interval` | `number` | Scan interval value in units of 0.625 ms. Default is `0x50`. 
| `window` | `number` | Scan window value in units of 0.625 ms. Default is `0x30`. 

The `filterPolicy` parameter can be one of the following:

| Name | Description |
| --- | :--- | 
| `GAP.ScanFilterPolicy.NONE` | No filtering.
| `GAP.ScanFilterPolicy.WHITELIST` | Receive advertisements only from whitelist devices.
| `GAP.ScanFilterPolicy.NOT_RESOLVED_DIRECTED` | Receive all undirected advertisements and all directed advertisements where the initiator address is a resolvable private address.
| `GAP.ScanFilterPolicy.WHITELIST_NOT_RESOLVED_DIRECTED` | Receive advertisements only from whitelist devices and all directed advertisements where the initiator address is a resolvable private address.

The `startScanning` function enables scanning for nearby peripherals.

If no `params` argument is provided, the default scan properties are used:

```javascript
class Scanner extends BLEClient {
	onReady() {
		this.startScanning();
	}
	onDiscovered(device) {
		trace("device discovered\n");
	}
}
```

Passing in a `params` object overrides the defaults. This example uses passive scanning at a 70ms interval:

```javascript
class Scanner extends BLEClient {
	onReady() {
		this.startScanning({ active:false, interval:0x70 });
	}
	onDiscovered(device) {
		trace("device discovered\n");
	}
}
```
***

#### `onDiscovered(device)`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `device` | `object` | A `device` object. See the section [Class Device](#classdevice) for more information. |

The `onDiscovered` callback function is called one or more times for each peripheral device discovered. 

To connect to a device named "Brian" from the `onDiscovered` callback:

```javascript
onDiscovered(device) {
	if ("Brian" == device.scanResponse.completeName) {
		this.connect(device);
	}
}
```

***
	
#### `stopScanning()`
The `stopScanning` function disables scanning for nearby peripherals.

***

#### `connect(device)`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `device` | `object` | A `device` object. See the section [Class Device](#classdevice) for more information. |

The `connect` function initiates a connection request between the `BLEClient` and a target peripheral `device`.

```javascript
onDiscovered(device) {
	this.connect(device);
}
onConnected(device) {
	trace("Connected to device\n");
}
```

***

#### `onConnected(device)`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `device` | `object` | A `device` object. See the section [Class Device](#classdevice) for more information. |

The `onConnected` callback function is called when the client connects to a target peripheral `device`.

***

#### `securityParameters`

BLE clients can optionally request link-layer security to protect data transferred between devices. The `securityParameters` property accessor function is used to configure the device security requirements and I/O capabilities.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `encryption` | `boolean` | Optional property to enable encryption. Default is `true`
| `bonding` | `boolean` | Optional property to enable bonding. Default is `false`
| `mitm` | `boolean` | Optional property to enable man-in-the-middle (MITM) protection. Default is `false`
| `ioCapability` | `object` | Optional `IOCapability` instance to configure the device I/O capabilities. Default is `IOCapability.NoInputNoOutput`. See the section [Class SM](#classsm) for more information.

To request MITM protection with encryption for a display-only device. The device will display a passkey when requested:

```javascript
import {IOCapability} from "sm";

onReady() {
	this.securityParameters = { mitm:true, ioCapability:IOCapability.DisplayOnly };
}
```

To request MITM protection with encryption and bonding for a device with both a display and keyboard. The device will request a passkey to be entered and encryption keys will be saved:

```javascript
import {IOCapability} from "sm";

onReady() {
	this.securityParameters = { mitm:true, bonding:true, ioCapability:IOCapability.KeyboardDisplay };
}
```

***

> **Note:** The `BLEClient` object hosts all callbacks for classes used with `BLEClient`.

<a id="classdevice"></a>
## Class Device
An instance of the `Device` class is instantiated by `BLEClient` and provided to the host app in the `BLEClient` `onDiscovered` and `onConnected` callbacks. While applications never instantiate a `Device` class instance directly, applications do call `Device` class functions to perform GATT service/characteristic discovery, negotiate a higher MTU and close the peripheral connection.

| `value` | `varies` | The `descriptor` value to write. The value `type` is defined by the service JSON, when available. Otherwise `value` is an `ArrayBuffer` or `String`. |

Use the `writeValue` function to write a descriptor value.

To enable characteristic value change notifications by writing 0x0001 to the [Client Characteristic Configuration](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Descriptors/org.bluetooth.descriptor.gatt.client_characteristic_configuration.xml) descriptor:

```javascript
const CCCD_UUID = uuid`2902`;

onDescriptors(descriptors) {
	let descriptor = descriptors.find(descriptor => descriptor.uuid.equals(CCCD_UUID));
	if (descriptor) {
		let value = Uint8Array.of(0x01, 0x00);	// little endian
		descriptor.writeValue(value.buffer);
	}
}
```
	
> **Note:** The `Characteristic` `enableNotifications` convenience function is typically used for this purpose, though writing the CCCD descriptor directly provides the same net result.

## Class Advertisement

The `Advertisement` class provides accessor functions to read common advertisement and scan response data types as JavaScript properties. The class is primarily used to parse the `scanResponseData` provided to BLE clients via the `onDiscovered` callback function's `device` parameter. The accessor functions return `undefined` if the associated data type is not available in the `scanResponseData`.

### Properties

| Name | Type | Description
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `buffer` | `object` | An `ArrayBuffer` containing the raw advertisement data bytes.
| `completeName` | `string` | The advertised complete local name.
| ` shortName` | `string` | The advertised shortened local name.
| `manufacturerSpecific` | `object` | An object containing the advertised manufacturer specific data.
| `flags` | `number` | The advertised flags value.
| `completeUUID16List` | `array` | The advertised complete 16-bit UUID list.
| `incompleteUUID16List` | `array` | The advertised incomplete 16-bit UUID list.

### Functions

#### `findIndex(type [,index])`
Use the `findIndex` function to find the index of a specific advertisement data type in the raw advertisement data bytes.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `type` | `number` | The `GAP.ADType` to search for. |
| `index` | `number` | The optional starting index to search from. Defaults to 0. |

### Examples 

To identify an advertised device with the complete name "Zip":

```javascript
onDiscovered(device) {
	let completeName = device.scanResponse.completeName;
	if (completeName == "ZIP")
		trace("Found ZIP device\n");
	}
}
```

To identify a [Blue Maestro Environment Monitor](https://www.bluemaestro.com/product/tempo-environment-monitor/) and read the temperature from the manufacturer specific data:

```javascript
onDiscovered(device) {
	let manufacturerSpecific = device.scanResponse.manufacturerSpecific;
	const TempoManufacturerID = 307; 
	
	// If this is a Tempo device...
	if (manufacturerSpecific && (TempoManufacturerID == manufacturerSpecific.identifier)) {
		let data = manufacturerSpecific.data;
		if (data[0] == 0 || data[0] == 1) {	// ...and product model T30 or THP
			let temperature = (data[3] | (data[4] << 8)) / 10;
			trace(`Temperature: ${temperature} ˚C\n`);
		}
	}
}
```

To search for the "TX Power Level" advertisement data type in the scan response data:

```javascript
onDiscovered(device) {
	let scanResponse = device.scanResponse;
	let index = scanResponse.findIndex(GAP.ADType.TX_POWER_LEVEL);
	if (-1 !== index)
		trace(`Found advertisement tx power level data at index ${index}\n`);
		const bytes = new Uint8Array(scanResponse.buffer);
		const txPowerLevel = bytes[index + 2];
	}
}
```

<a id="classbytes"></a>
## Class Bytes

The private `Bytes` class extends `ArrayBuffer`. Applications typically use the provided `uuid` and `address` tagged templates to create a `Bytes` instance from hex strings.
 
#### Constructor Description

#### `Bytes(bytes [,littleEndian])`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `bytes` | `object` or `string` | The ArrayBuffer `bytes` to set. The bytes can be a String or ArrayBuffer. |
| `littleEndian` | `boolean` | When set `true` the contents of the ArrayBuffer are stored in reverse order. Default is `false`.|
### Functions

#### `address`\``string``

The `address` tagged template is used to convert a Bluetooth address expressed as a hex string to a `Bytes` instance.

```javascript
import {address} from "btutils";

const DEVICE_ADDRESS = address`66:55:44:33:22:11`;
```

#### `uuid`\``string``

The `uuid` tagged template is used to convert a Bluetooth UUID expressed as a hex string to a `Bytes` instance.

```javascript
import {uuid} from "btutils";

const HTM_SERVICE = uuid`1809`;
const CHARACTERISTIC_RX_UUID = uuid`6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`;
```

#### `equals(buffer)`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `buffer` | `object` | The `Bytes` instance to compare. |

The `equals` function returns `true` if the instance ArrayBuffer data equals the data contained in `buffer`.
 
```javascript
import {uuid} from "btutils";

const HTM_SERVICE = uuid`1809`;
onServices(services) {
	let found = services[0].uuid.equals(HTM_SERVICE);
	if (found)
		trace("found HTM service\n");
}
```

#### `toString()`

The `toString` helper function returns a printable hex string of the `Bytes` contents. The string is formatted in big endian order with separators.

```javascript
onDiscovered(device) {
	trace(`Found device with address ${device.address}\n`);
}
onServices(services) {
	if (services.length) {
		trace(`Found service with UUID ${services[0].uuid}\n`);
	}
}
```

<a id="bleserver"></a>
## BLE Server
A BLE server/peripheral can connect to one BLE client and typically performs the following steps to send notifications to a BLE client:

1. Start advertising so that clients can discover the peripheral
2. Establish a connection with a client
3. Accept characteristic value change notification request(s)
4. Notify characteristic value changes.

The following abbreviated code from the [heart-rate-server](../../../examples/network/ble/heart-rate-server) example app shows a typical server flow:

```javascript
onReady() {
	this.bpm = [0, 60]; // flags, beats per minute
	this.startAdvertising({
		advertisingData: {flags: 6, completeName: "Moddable HRS", completeUUID16List: [uuid`180D`, uuid`180F`]}
	});
}
onConnected() {
	this.stopAdvertising();
}
onCharacteristicNotifyEnabled(characteristic) {
	this.startMeasurements(characteristic);
}
startMeasurements(characteristic) {
	this.bump = +1;
	this.timer = Timer.repeat(id => {
		this.notifyValue(characteristic, this.bpm);
		this.bpm[1] += this.bump;
		if (this.bpm[1] == 65) {
			this.bump = -1;
			this.bpm[1] == 64;
		}
		else if (this.bpm[1] == 55) {
			this.bump = +1;
			this.bpm[1] == 56;
		}
	}, 1000);
}
```

GATT services are automatically deployed by the BLE server when launched. A BLE server is fundamentally asynchronous and results are always delivered to the `BLEServer` class callback methods, e.g. `onReady`, `onConnected`, etc. above. The following sections describe the `BLEServer` class, properties, and callbacks.

<a id="classbleserver"></a>
## Class BLEServer

The `BLEServer` class provides access to the BLE server features.

```javascript
import BLEServer from "bleserver";
```

### `constructor([dictionary])`

The `BLEServer` constructor takes a single argument, an optional dictionary of initialization parameters.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `deployServices` | `boolean` | Optional property to deploy [GATT Services](#gattservices). Default is `true`. Set to `false` to not deploy GATT services.

### Functions

#### `onReady()`
Applications must wait for the `onReady` callback before calling other `BLEServer` functions:

```javascript
class Server extends BLEServer {
	onReady() {
		/* stack is ready to use */
	}
}
let server = new BLEServer;
```

***

#### `deviceName`
The `deviceName` property accessor function is used to set/get the Bluetooth peripheral device name.

```javascript
class Advertiser extends BLEServer {
	onReady() {
		this.deviceName = "My BLE Device";
		trace(`My device is named ${this.deviceName}\n`);
	}
}
let advertiser = new BLEServer;
```

***

#### `localAddress`
The read-only `localAddress` property accessor function returns the Bluetooth peripheral's local address as a [Bytes](#classbytes) object.

```javascript
import Hex from "hex";

class Advertiser extends BLEServer {
	onReady() {
		trace(`device address: ${Hex.toString(this.localAddress, ":")}\n`);
	}
}
```

***

#### `securityParameters`

BLE servers can optionally request link-layer security to protect data transferred between devices. The `securityParameters` property accessor function is used to configure the device security requirements and I/O capabilities.

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `encryption` | `boolean` | Optional property to enable encryption. Default is `true`
| `bonding` | `boolean` | Optional property to enable bonding. Default is `false`

| `ioCapability` | `object` | Optional `IOCapability` instance to configure the device I/O capabilities. Default is `IOCapability.NoInputNoOutput`. See the section [Class SM](#classsm) for more information.

To request MITM protection with encryption for a display-only device. The device will display a passkey when requested:

```javascript
import {IOCapability} from "sm";

onReady() {
	this.securityParameters = { mitm:true, ioCapability:IOCapability.DisplayOnly };
}
```

To request MITM protection with encryption and bonding for a device with both a display and keyboard. The device will request a passkey to be entered and encryption keys will be saved:

```javascript
import {IOCapability} from "sm";

onReady() {
	this.securityParameters = { mitm:true, bonding:true, ioCapability:IOCapability.KeyboardDisplay };
}
```

```javascript
onCharacteristicNotifyEnabled(characteristic) {
	this.startNotifications(characteristic);
}
startNotifications(characteristic) {
	this.timer = Timer.repeat(id => {
		this.notifyValue(characteristic, ArrayBuffer.fromString("hello"));

The `onCharacteristicWritten` callback is called when a client writes a service characteristic value on demand. The `BLEServer` application is responsible for handling the write request.

The following abbreviated example from the [wifi-connection-server](../../../examples/network/ble/wifi-connection-server) example shows how characteristic write requests are handled. The `SSID` and `password` characteristics are strings and the `control` characteristic is a numeric value. When the BLE client writes the value 1 to the `control` characteristic, the app closes the client connection and initiates a WiFi connection:

```javascript
onCharacteristicWritten(characteristic, value) {
	if ("SSID" == characteristic.name)
		this.ssid = value;
	else if ("password" == characteristic.name)
		this.password = value;
	else if ("control" == characteristic.name) {

```javascript
onReady() {
	this.status = 10;
}
onCharacteristicRead(characteristic) {
	if ("status" == characteristic.name)
		return this.status;
}
```
***

#### `disconnect()`

***

<a id="gattservices"></a>
## GATT Services
GATT services are defined by JSON files located in a BLE server or client project's `bleservices` directory. The JSON files are optional for BLE clients. Each JSON file defines a single service with one or more characteristics. The JSON is automatically converted to platform-specific native code by the Moddable `mcconfig` command line tool and the compiled object code is linked to the app.

The JSON file for a service consists of an object with a single `service` property. The `service` property is an object that includes the following top-level properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `uuid` | `string` | Service UUID.
| `characteristics` | `object` | An object with details about the service characteristic(s). Each key corresponds to a characteristic name.

Each item in the `characteristics` object contains the following properties. Note that only the `uuid` and `type` properties are required for BLE client applications that include GATT services JSON files:

| Property | Type | Description | Required by BLE client |
| --- | --- | --- | :--- |
| `uuid` | `string` | Characteristic UUID. | Y
| `maxBytes` | `number` | Maximum number of bytes required to store the characteristic value.
| `type` | `string` | Optional JavaScript data value type. Supported types include `Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `String`, `Uint8`, `Uint8Array`, `Int8Array`, `Int16Array`, `Uint16`, `Uint16Array`, and `Uint32`. If the `type` property is not present, the data value type defaults to `ArrayBuffer`. The `BLEServer` and `BLEClient` classes automatically convert characteristic values delivered in buffers by the underlying BLE implementation to the requested `type`. | Y
| `permissions` | `string` | Characteristic permissions. Supported permissions include `read`, `readEncrypted`, `write`, and `writeEncrypted`. Multiple permissions can be specified by comma-separating permission strings, but only one of read/readEncrypted and write/writeEncrypted can be specified for each characteristic.
| `properties` | `string` | Characteristic properties. Supported properties include `read`, `write`, `writeNoResponse`, `notify`, `indicate` and `extended`. Multiple properties can be specified by comma-separating property strings.
| `value` | `array`, `string`, or `number` | Optional characteristic value. The `BLEServer` class automatically converts the value specified here to the type specified by the `type` property.

Characteristics that include a `value` property are considered static. The `BLEServer` class automatically responds to read requests for static characteristic values, further reducing the script code required to host a GATT service.

The following is an example of JSON corresponding to a Bluetooth [Battery Service](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Services/org.bluetooth.service.battery_service.xml):

	{
		"service": {
			"uuid": "180F",
			"characteristics": {
				"battery": {
					"uuid": "2A19",
					"maxBytes": 1,
					"type": "Uint8",
					"permissions": "read",
					"properties": "read",
					"value": 85
				},
			}
		}
	}
	
The service is defined as follows:

* The service UUID is 0x180F
* The service contains a single characteristic named "battery"
	* The characteristic UUID is 0x2A19
	* The characteristic represents an unsigned 8-bit value
	* The characteristic value is 85 and clients only have permission to read the characteristic

<a id="blesecurity"></a>
## BLE Security

BLE clients and servers use the `securityParameters` property accessor to optionally request link-layer security to protect data transferred between devices. Passkey pairing requires both devices to exchange and confirm the code before establishing a connection. Once the pairing process is complete, the connection and data transferred is encrypted. The BLE Security Manager (SM) defines the methods and protocols for pairing and key distribution.


<a id="classsm"></a>
## Class SM

The `SM` class provides objects used to configure BLE client and server security requirements and device capabilities. The `SM` class is available to both `BLEClient` and `BLEServer` classes. The security callback functions defined here are hosted by the `BLEClient` and `BLEServer` classes.

The `IOCapability` object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `NoInputNoOutput` | `number` | Device has no input or output capabilities
| `DisplayOnly` | `number` | Device has only output capability
| `KeyboardOnly` | `number` | Device has only input capability
| `KeyboardDisplay` | `number` | Device has input and output capabilities
| `DisplayYesNo` | `number` | Device has output capability and button feedback for a Yes or No response

To request MITM protection with encryption on a keyboard device:

```javascript
import {IOCapability} from "sm";

onReady() {
	this.securityParameters = { mitm:true, ioCapability:IOCapability.KeyboardOnly };
}
```

Call the `passkeyReply` function from the `onPasskeyConfirm` callback function to confirm the passkey displayed by the peer device:

```javascript
onPasskeyConfirm(params) {
	// passkey is valid
	this.passkeyReply(params.address, true);
}
```

***

#### `onSecurityParameters(params)`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `params` | `object` | Device security properties applied.

The `onSecurityParameters` callback is called after the device security requirements and I/O capabilities have been set.

```javascript
import {IOCapability} from "sm";

onReady() {
	this.securityParameters = { mitm:true, ioCapability:IOCapability.NoInputNoOutput };
}
onSecurityParameters() {
	this.startScanning();
}
```

***

| `passkey` | `number` | The passkey to confirm

The `onPasskeyConfirm` callback is called when the user needs to confirm a passkey value displayed on a peer device. The callback calls `passkeyReply` passing `true` or `false` to confirm the passkey value.

```javascript
onPasskeyConfirm(params) {
	trace(`confirm passkey: ${params.passkey}\n`);
	
	// passkey is valid
	this.passkeyReply(params.address, true);
}
```
***

#### `onPasskeyDisplay(params)`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `params` | `object` | Properties associated with the passkey display.

The `params` object contains the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| `address` | `object` | `ArrayBuffer` containing peer device Bluetooth address
| `passkey` | `number` | The passkey to display

The `onPasskeyDisplay` callback is called when the device needs to display a passkey.

```javascript
onPasskeyDisplay(params) {
	// display passkey on screen
	trace(`display passkey: ${params.passkey}\n`);
}
```

***

#### `onPasskeyInput(params)`

| Argument | Type | Description |

## BLE Whitelisting

Whitelisting provides filtering of peer devices by Bluetooth address. A BLE client can use the whitelist to only receive peripheral scan responses and hence subsequent connections to devices in the whitelist. A BLE peripheral can use the whitelist to filter BLE client scans and connections. Whitelist filtering provides enhanced security by limiting communication to known and trusted BLE devices.

There is one BLE whitelist used by both the BLE client and server. The maximum number of whitelist entries allowed is platform-specific.

> **Note:** Whitelisting is not currently supported on the Blue Gecko platform.

<a id="classgapwhitelist"></a>
## Class GAPWhitelist

The `GAPWhitelist` class provides functions for manipulating the BLE whitelist.

```javascript
import GAPWhitelist from "gapwhitelist";
```

### Functions

#### `add(address [,addressType])`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `address` | `string` or `object` | The peer address to whitelist.
| `addressType` | `number` | Optional peer address type. Defaults to `GAP.AddressType.PUBLIC`.

Use the `add` function to add a peer device to the whitelist.

To add a Bluetooth address to the whitelist and receive only scan responses from devices in the whitelist:

```javascript
onReady() {
	GAPWhitelist.add("B4:99:4C:34:D7:A7");
	this.startScanning({ filterPolicy:GAP.ScanFilterPolicy.WHITELIST });
}
```

To add a Bluetooth address to the whitelist and limit scan requests and connections to devices in the whitelist using a filter policy:

```javascript
onReady() {
	this.deviceName = "Moddable HRM";
	GAPWhitelist.add("8C:10:21:79:C9:F3");
	this.onDisconnected();
}
onDisconnected() {
	this.stopMeasurements();
	this.startAdvertising({
		filterPolicy: GAP.AdvFilterPolicy.WHITELIST_SCANS_CONNECTIONS,
		advertisingData: {flags: 6, completeName: this.deviceName, completeUUID16List: [HEART_RATE_SERVIE_UUID, BATTERY_SERVICE_UUID]
	});
}
```

***

#### `remove(address [,addressType])`

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- | 
| `address` | `string` or `object` | The peer address to whitelist.
| `addressType` | `number` | Optional peer address type. Defaults to `GAP.AddressType.PUBLIC`.

Use the `remove` function to remove a peer device from the whitelist.

#### `clear()`

Use the `clear` function to remove all peer devices from the whitelist.

## BLE Apps on ESP32 Platform
The `mcconfig` command line tool **automatically** configures the required ESP-IDF BLE options required by the host app.
The [sdkconfig.defaults](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/public/build/devices/esp32/xsProj/sdkconfig.defaults) configuration file in the Moddable SDK presets the following core BLE options:

	CONFIG_BTDM_CONTROLLER_PINNED_TO_CORE=0
	CONFIG_BTDM_CONTROLLER_HCI_MODE_VHCI=y
	CONFIG_BLUEDROID_ENABLED=y
	CONFIG_BLUEDROID_PINNED_TO_CORE=0
	CONFIG_BTC_TASK_STACK_SIZE=3072
	CONFIG_BLE_SMP_ENABLE=y
	CONFIG_BT_ACL_CONNECTIONS=1
	CONFIG_SMP_ENABLE=y
	CONFIG_BT_RESERVE_DRAM=0x10000
	
When building a BLE client or server app, the `mcconfig` tool enables the ESP-IDF BLE components by setting the corresponding option:

	CONFIG_BT_ENABLED=y

When building a BLE client app, the `CONFIG_GATTC_ENABLE` option is also set:

	CONFIG_GATTC_ENABLE=y

When building a BLE server app, the `CONFIG_GATTS_ENABLE` option is also set:

	CONFIG_GATTS_ENABLE=y

>**Note:** BLE options can be further customized, if necessary, by editing the `sdkconfig.defaults` file before building the host app. For example, the `CONFIG_BT_ACL_CONNECTIONS` value can be increased to support more than one BLE client connection. This value should match the `max_connections` value in the application manifest.

Once any sdkconfig.defaults file changes have been made, build the [scanner](../../../examples/network/ble/scanner) BLE app for the ESP32 platform:

	cd $MODDABLE/examples/network/ble/scanner
	mcconfig -d -m -p esp32

## BLE Apps on Blue Gecko Platform
Building and deploying BLE apps on Blue Gecko follow the same workflow outlined in our [Gecko developer documentation](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/public/documentation/devices/gecko/GeckoBuild.md). For BLE apps, we recommend starting from the `soc-ibeacon` Simplicity Studio example project.

The [make.blue.mk](../../../tools/mcconfig/geck0/make.blue.mk) makefile includes variables that define the Gecko target platform, kit and part. The makefile is configured by default to build apps for the Blue Gecko [EFR32BG13P632F512GM48](https://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/bluetooth/blue-gecko-bluetooth-low-energy-socs/device.efr32bg13p632f512gm48) Bluetooth low energy chip mounted on the [BRD4104A](https://www.silabs.com/documents/login/reference-manuals/brd4104a-rm.pdf) 2.4 GHz 10 dBm Radio Board. To configure the build for a different Blue Gecko target, change the makefile `GECKO_BOARD`, `GECKO_PART`, `HWKIT` and `HWINC` variables accordingly.

To build the [scanner](../../../examples/network/ble/scanner) BLE app `xs_gecko.a` archive for Blue Gecko:

	cd $MODDABLE/examples/network/ble/scanner
	mcconfig -d -m -p gecko/blue

After building the BLE archive, the archive is linked to the native app hosted in Simplicity Studio. The `main()` native code function for a basic BLE client/server app can be reduced to the following:

	void main(void)
	{
		initMcu();
		initBoard();
		initApp();
		
		xs_setup();
		
		while (1) {
			xs_loop();
		}
	}

BLE apps require additional stack and heap. We've been able to run the Moddable BLE example apps using the following values:

	__STACK_SIZE=0x2000
	__HEAP_SIZE=0xA000
	
Simplicity Studio includes a **BLE GATT Configurator** to define BLE services. Moddable apps define BLE services in JSON files and hence don't use the `gatt_db.c` and `gatt_db.h` files generated by the configurator tool. These two files must be removed from the Simplicity Studio project.
