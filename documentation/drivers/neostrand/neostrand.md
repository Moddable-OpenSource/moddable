# NeoStrand driver

The NeoStrand driver is a subclass of the [NeoPixel](http://blog.moddable.com/blog/neopixels/) driver to add an effects engine for dynamic color displays with strings or strips of NeoPixel (WS2811/WS2812-like) LEDs.

Terminology:

* A **strand** is a strip of NeoPixels.
* An **effect** is a group of settings and an action function which makes a change to state of the NeoPixel strip or takes some other action.
* A **scheme** is a set of effects that are applied to the strip.

## Adding NeoStrand to a Project

To add the NeoStrand functionality to a project, add the path to the module in your **manifest.json**.

	"modules": {
		"*": [
			/* other modules here */
			"$(MODDABLE)/modules/drivers/neostrand/*",
       ],
    },

### Using NeoStrand

Import the NeoStrand class:

```js
import NeoStrand from "neostrand";
```

NeoStrand is subclass of NeoPixel, so we use the same constructor dictionary to set the length, pin connected to the Data signal on the LED strip, and order of the pixels.

```js
const strand = new NeoStrand({length: 50, pin: 22, order: "RGB"});
```

> Note: if you notice flicker, you may have to adjust the timing for your strip. Check your specification sheet. The durations are in 50ns increments. **NeoPixel** has been extended to allow custom timings.
>
```
const Timing_WS2811 = {
    mark:  { level0: 1, duration0: 800,  level1: 0, duration1: 450, },
    space: { level0: 1, duration0: 400,   level1: 0, duration1: 800, },
    reset: { level0: 0, duration0: 30000, level1: 0, duration1: 30000, } };
>
const strand = new NeoStrand({length: 50, pin: 22, order: "RGB",
							  timing: Timing_WS2812B});
```

&nbsp;

> Note: You may want to tone down your lights during development so you don't blind yourself.
> 
> ```js
> strand.brightness(10);
> ```
> This diminishes your color range, so use with care. The default brightness is *64* and maximum is 255.

### Schemes

A scheme is a set of effects to apply to a strand. A scheme has one or more effects applied in the specified order. Setting the new scheme takes effect immediately, even if the strand is already running.

```js
let schemes = [];

let marqueeDictionary = { strand };

schemes.push( [ new NeoStrand.Marquee( marqueeDictionary ) ]);

strand.setScheme(schemes[0]);
strand.start(50);
```

The parameter sent to `start` defines the delay between updates of the effects. It is the number of milliseconds between calls to the effect function. Reducing the number may cause some effects to render more smoothly at the expense of CPU load. If it is set too high, long strands may not fully update or update incorrectly.

### Effect Dictionary

Effect parameters are specified in a dictionary.

```js
let marqueeDictionary = { strand, start: 0, end: (strand.length / 2) };
```
The dictionary must contain the strand. `start` and `end` define a span of pixels to be influenced by the effect. Use `Object.assign` to copy the dictionary if you want to make effect variants.

```js
let marqee2 = Object.assign({}, marqueeDictionary,
		{ start: (strand.length / 2) + 1, end: strand.length, reverse: 1 });
```

A scheme can contain more than one effect.

```js
schemes.push( [ new NeoStrand.Marquee( marqueeDictionary ),
                new NeoStrand.Marquee( marquee2 ) ]) );
```

### Control

You can start and stop the scheme at any time. The strand state will remain. You may want to set all LEDs to 0 after stopping the scheme.

```js
strand.stop();
strand.fill(strand.makeRGB(0, 0, 0));
strand.update();
```

### Effects

Effects are what make up a scheme. They usually cause one or more of the LEDs to change state over time. However, since the effect action function is JavaScript, you can do just about anything - trigger GPIOs, play a sound, fire a cannon.

Effects are subclassed from `NeoStrandEffect` and take a dictionary of configuration parameters. The configuration dictionary _must_ contain the `strand` to which this effect will be applied.

```js
    let baseDictionary = { strand, start: 0, end: strand.length, loop: 1 };
```
There are a number of common parameters that are used in almost every effect. Effects may also specify their own parameters.

A [list of built-in effects](#builtin) can be found later in this document.

#### Common Effect Parameters

| Parameter | default | range | description |
|---|---|---|---|
strand | (none) | | The NeoStrand to which this effect applied
start | `0` | [0..strand.length] | The index of the first pixel of effect
end | `strand.length` | [0..strand.length] | The index of the last pixel of effect
size | `strand.length` | [0..strand.length] | The length of one hue cycle, in pixels
duration | `1000` | | The duration of one complete cycle of the effect, in ms
reverse | `0` | [0, 1] | Set to 1 to run the effect in reverse, i.e. run the timeline of the effect backwards 
loop | `1` | [0, 1] | Set to 1 to loop the effect

`start` and `end` define the span of pixels that this effect will operate on. `duration` is the length of one cycle of the effect.

When one cycle of the effect is complete, the effect will restart if the `loop` parameter is set to `1`.

If loop is `0` the effect's `onComplete()` function will be called.

`reverse` will reverse the effect, starting at the end state, and finishing with the begin state.

### Custom Effects

An effect is a subclassed from the **NeoStrandEffect** class. The constructor sets parameters from the supplied dictionary. The `activate` method sets up a [`timeline`](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/public/documentation/piu/piu.md#timeline-object). In the example below, the `effectValue` varys from 0 to `effect.dur` and is called when the value changes.

```js
class MyEffect extends NeoStrandEffect {
    constructor(dictionary) {
        super(dictionary);
        this.name = "MyEffect"
}

activate(effect) {
    effect.timeline.on(effect, { effectValue: [ 0, effect.dur ] }, effect.dur, null, 0);
    effect.reset(effect);
}

set effectValue(value) {
    for (let i=this.start; i<this.end; i++) {
    	//
    	// For each pixel in the segment, perform the pixel operations
    	// value will be in the range [ 0, effect.dur ] or whatever
    	// range the effect specifies when it creates the timeline
    	// in activate().
    	// ...
    }
}
```

Use the custom effect by creating an instance with the desired parameters and including it in an array sent to the `changeScheme` function:

```js
strand.setScheme( [ new MyEffect(strand) ] );
```

<a id="pulse"></a>
### Pulse

The `Pulse` effect sets `size` number of pixels at a location and then moves it toward either (or both) ends. The `mode` parameter specifies whether to add, subtract or set the pixels' RGB values.

| Parameter | default | range | description |
|---|---|---|---|
strand | (none) | | The NeoStrand to which this effect is applied
start | `0` | [0..strand.length] | The index of the first pixel of effect
end | `strand.length` | [0..strand.length] | The index of the last pixel of effect

duration | 3000 | | time of one pulse cycle, in ms
reverse | `0` | [0, 1] | Set to 1 to run the effect in reverse, i.e. run the timeline of the effect backwards 
loop | `1` | [0, 1] | Set to 1 to loop the effect
position | "random" | [-strand.length..strand.length] | index of the pulse starting pixel<br>negative numbers are off-strand and okay<br>"random" picks a random starting location
mode | 1 | [-1, 0, 1] | **1** to add, **-1** to subtract, or **0** set the pixel color

end | strand.length | [0..strand.length] | index of last pixel of effect
pattern | [ 0x130000, 0x131313 ] | | array of RGB colors
mode | 1 | [-1, 0, 1] | **1** to add, **-1** to subtract, or **0** set the pixel color

<a id="dim"></a>
### Dim

The `Dim` effect reduces the color for each pixel in the span over over the `duration`. For example, if a pixel is fully on (ie. 0xFFFFFF) it will gradually decrease to fully off when `duration` ms elapses.

| Parameter | default | range | description |
|---|---|---|---|
strand | (none) | | The NeoStrand to which this effect is applied
start | 0 | [0..strand.length] | index of first pixel of effect
end | strand.length | [0..strand.length] | index of last pixel of effect
duration | 1000 | | time to reduce a full-brightness pixel to off, in ms


## Making a custom effect

To make your own effect, pick an existing one that most closely matches your vision and go from there.

Let's make a random color effect. It will set `size` pixels to a random color, change colors every `duration` ms.

<a id="Random"></a>

| Parameter | default | range | description |
|---|---|---|---|
strand | (none) | | The NeoStrand to which this effect is applied
start | 0 | [0..strand.length] | index of first pixel of effect
end | strand.length | [0..strand.length] | index of last pixel of effect
duration | 1000 | | length time between color changes, in ms
size | 5 | [0..strand.length] | size of each color
max | 127 | [0..255] | maximium value of random RGB component

Using *Pattern* as a starting point, we'll change the class name and constructor, set up the timeline in `activate` and provide a setter for the changing `effectValue`. The `loopPrepare` function will be called before a looping effect starts or restarts.
	

```js
class RandomColor extends NeoStrandEffect {
    constructor(dictionary) {
        super(dictionary);
        this.name = "RandomColor"
        this.size = dictionary.size ? dictionary.size : 5;
        this.max = dictionary.max ? dictionary.max : 127;
        this.loop = 1;			// force loop
    }

    loopPrepare(effect) { effect.colors_set = 0; }

    activate(effect) {
        effect.timeline.on(effect, { effectValue: [ 0, effect.dur ] }, effect.dur, null, 0);
        effect.reset(effect);
    }

    set effectValue(value) {
        if (0 == this.colors_set) {
            for (let i=this.start; i<this.end; i++) {
                if (0 == (i % this.size))
                    this.color = this.strand.makeRGB(Math.random() * this.max, Math.random() * this.max, Math.random() * this.max);
                this.strand.set(i, this.color, this.start, this.end);
            }
            this.colors_set = 1;
        }
    }
}

```

Then create and add the effect your scheme list and give it a try.

```js
let randomColorScheme = [ new RandomColor({ strand }) ];
manySchemes.push( randomColorScheme );
```

## Timing

Timing specifications for the various driver chips of the LEDs are included for reference below. 

```js
const Timing_WS2812B = {
    mark:  { level0: 1, duration0: 900,   level1: 0, duration1: 350, },
    space: { level0: 1, duration0: 350,   level1: 0, duration1: 900, },
    reset: { level0: 0, duration0: 30000, level1: 0, duration1: 30000, } };

const Timing_WS2811 = {
    mark:  { level0: 1, duration0: 800,   level1: 0, duration1: 450, },
    space: { level0: 1, duration0: 400,   level1: 0, duration1: 800, },
    reset: { level0: 0, duration0: 30000, level1: 0, duration1: 30000, } };
```
