# ST7735 display driver

Revised: January 1, 2018

The [ST7735](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ST7735R_V0.2.pdf) LCD controller drives 16-bits per pixel (RGB565LE) displays. Displays are up to 240 pixels wide and 320 pixels high. This implementation has been tested with the "[green tab](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2088)" display from Adafruit at 128 x 160.

**Note**: The ST7735 is a direct subclass of the ILI9341 display driver. The only difference is register initialization. See the ILI9341 driver's [documentation](../ili9341/ili9341.md) for details.

### Adding ST7735 to a project
To add the ST7735 driver to a project, include its manifest:

	"include": [
		/* other includes here */
		"$(MODULES)/drivers/st7735/manifest.json",
	],

If using Commodetto or Piu, set the `screen` property of the `config` object in the manifest to `st7735` to make ST7735 the default display driver. If there is no touch input, set the touch driver name to an empty string to disable it.

	"config": {
		"screen": "st7735",
		"touch": "",
	},

### Defines
Because the ST7735 driver is a subclass of the ILI9341 drive, its defines object must use "ili9341" not "st7735".

	"defines": {
		"ili9341": {
			"width": 160,
			"height": 128,
		}
	}
