**Warning**: These notes are preliminary. Omissions and errors are likely. If you encounter problems, please ask for assistance.

The [SSD1351](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1351-Revision+1.3.pdf) OLED display controller drives 16-bits per pixel (RGB565LE) displays. Displays are up to 128 pixels wide and 128 pixels high.

### Adding SSD1351 to a project
To add the SSD1351 driver to a project, include its manifest:

	"include": [
		/* other includes here */
		"$(MODULES)/drivers/ssd1351/manifest.json",
	],

If using Commodetto or Piu, set the `screen` property of the `config` object in the manifest to `ssd1351` to make SSD1351 the default display driver. Since there is no touch input, set the touch driver name to an empty string to disable it.

	"config": {
		"screen": "ssd1351",
		"touch": "",
	},

### Defines
In the `defines` object, declare the pixel `width` and `height`.

	"defines": {
		"ssd1351": {
			"width": 128,
			"height": 128,
		}
	}
	
The optional `offset_column` and `offset_row` properties offset the `x` and `y` position of the image within the display, which is useful for some configurations.

	"defines": {
		"ssd1351": {
			/* other properties here */
			"offset_column": 4,
			"offset_row": 0,
		}
	}

The optional `initialization` property is used to override the default initialization of registers on the SSD1351.

	"defines": {
		"ssd1351": {
			/* other properties here */
			"initialization": [
				"0xFD, 1, 0x12,"
				"0xFD, 1, 0xB1,"
				"0xAE, 0,"
				"0xB3, 1, 0xF1,"
				"0xCA, 1, 0x7F,"
				"0xA0, 1, 0x74,"
				"0x15, 2, 0x00, 0x7F,"
				"0x75, 2, 0x00, 0x7F,"
				"0xA1, 1, 0,"
				"0xA2, 1, 0x00,"
				"0xB5, 1, 0x00,"
				"0xAB, 1, 0x01,"
				"0xB1, 1, 0x32,"
				"0xBE, 1, 0x05,"
				"0xA6, 0,"
				"0xC1, 3, 0xC8, 0x80, 0xC8,"
				"0xC7, 1, 0x0F,"
				"0xB4, 3, 0xA0, 0xB5, 0x55,"
				"0xB6, 1, 0x01,"
				"0xAF, 0,"
				"0x00"
			]
		}
	}

The SSD1351 driver requires 16-bit color pixels as input. When building with `mcconfig`, set the pixel format to `rgb565le` on the command line:

	mcconfig -m -p esp -f rgb565le

### Configuring SPI
The `defines` object must contain the `spi_port`, along with the `DC` and `CS` pin numbers. If a `RST` pin is provided, the device will be reset when the constructor is invoked. If the `cs_port`, `dc_port`, or `rst_port` properties are not provided, they default to NULL. 

	"defines": {
		"ssd1351": {
			/* other properties here */	
			"cs_pin": 4,
			"dc_pin": 2,
			"rst_pin": 0,
			"spi_port": "#HSPI"
		}
	}

The `hz` property, when present, specifies the SPI bus speed. The default value is 10,000,000 Hz which is near the maximum SPI speed supported by the SSD1351.
