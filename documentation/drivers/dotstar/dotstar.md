**Warning**: These notes are preliminary. Omissions and errors are likely. If you encounter problems, please ask for assistance.

The DotStar display controller drives strings of color LED lights. The displays are available from [Adafuit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/overview) in various lengths and configurations

These LEDs are not strictly a display, but they can be seen as one row of a display. There are options to purchase them in a organized in a rectangular grid, which is like a display.

The [dotstar](../../../examples/drivers/dotstar) example works with a 144 LED DotStar string. It scans through an image one row at a time to update the pixels on the DotStar string.

### Adding DotStar to a project
To add the DotStar driver to a project, include its manifest:

	"include": [
		/* other includes here */
		"$(MODULES)/drivers/dotstar/manifest.json",
	],

### Pixel format
The DotStar driver requires 16-bit color (`rgb565le`) pixels.

	mcconfig -m -p esp -f rgb565le

### Defines
In the `defines` object, the optional `brightness` property may be set, where 255 is brightest and 0 is off.

	"defines": {
		"dotstar": {
			"brightness": 64,
		}
	}

### Configuring SPI
The `defines` object must contain the `spi_port`. 

	"defines": {
		"dotstar": {
			/* other properties here */	
			"spi_port": "#HSPI"
		}
	}

The `hz` property, when present, specifies the SPI bus speed. The default value is 20,000,000 Hz which is near the maximum SPI speed supported by the controllers.
