Revised: April 6, 2023

This directory contains documentation for the Moddable SDK.

### Getting Started

The [Getting Started Guide](./Moddable%20SDK%20-%20Getting%20Started.md) provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and building the Moddable SDK for macOS, Linux, and Windows. It also provides instructions for keeping the Moddable SDK tools and build environment up to date over time.

Guides for working with specific microcontrollers supported by the Moddable SDK are in the  [devices](./devices) directory. These include links to additional detail for specific development boards including Moddable One, Moddable Two, Moddable Three, and Moddable Four.
