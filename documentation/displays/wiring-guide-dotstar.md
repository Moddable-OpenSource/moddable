## Specs

| | |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Size** | 144 LED strip (5mm x 5mm LEDs) 
| **Type** | ADA102 LED
| **Interface** | SPI
| **Drivers** | [dotstar](../../documentation/drivers/dotstar/dotstar.md)
| **Availability** | [Adafruit DotStar](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241)
| **Description** |  Adafruit uses the ADA102 LED's in their DotStar digital LEDs. This allows individual LED control with 2 wire SPI. These LEDs are not strictly a display, but they can be seen as one row of a display. There are options to purchase them in a organized in a rectangular grid, which is like a display.

## Moddable example code

The [dotstar](../../examples/drivers/dotstar/) example works with a 144 LED strip. It scans through an image one row at a time to update the pixels on the DotStar string.

```
cd $MODDABLE/examples/drivers/dotstar
mcconfig -d -m -p esp
```

## ESP8266 Pinout

**Note:** Dotstar requires 5V data signals so signal lines must be run through a logic converter to boost them to 5V. The [74AHCT125](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1787) or a similar shifter will work.
