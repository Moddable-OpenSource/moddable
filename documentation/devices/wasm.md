## macOS

1. Clone the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) repository into your `~/Projects` directory and activate the latest version.

	```text
	cd ~/Projects
	git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
	cd emsdk
	./emsdk install latest
	./emsdk activate latest
	```
	
	If you already have the Emscripten repository, upgrade to the latest version using the following commands:
	
	```text
	cd ~/Projects/emsdk
	git pull
	./emsdk install latest
	./emsdk activate latest
	```
	
	> We last tested using version 2.0.24 (commit `e2dc11e0dbd8f9367d70c76e57cdb9a45515390e`).
	
2. Clone the [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) repository into your `~/Projects` directory and build it.

	```text
	cd ~/Projects
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen.git
	cd binaryen
	cmake . && make
	```
	
	> We last tested using wasm-opt version 101 (commit `aec8d12282b5279b80e79f21d54491db5d55278e`)	
3. 	Setup the `PATH` and other environment variables by pasting the following commands into your `~/.profile`. The first command sources a shell script that sets environment variables for Emscripten. The second updates your `PATH` to include BinaryEn.

	```text
	source ~/Projects/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
	export PATH=~/Projects/binaryen/bin:$PATH
	```

	> Note: These instructions assume that your shell sources from `~/.profile` when a new terminal is opened. That may not be the case depending on what shell you use and how you have it configured. Starting with macOS Catalina, the [default shell is `zsh`](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208050) which uses `~/.zshrc` instead.

	> Note: You must open a new shell instance or manually run the export statements in your shell before proceeding. Adding the export statements to your `~/.profile` does not update the environment variables in active shell instances.

4. Build the Moddable Wasm tools from the command line:

	```text
	cd ${MODDABLE}/build/makefiles/wasm
	make
	```
	
5. To test, build the `balls` example for the `wasm` target.

	```text
	cd $MODDABLE/examples/piu/balls
	mcconfig -d -m -p wasm
	```
	
	You can run the app that's built in the browser by hosting it on a local HTTP server. Python provides a simple tool for doing this.
	
	If you are using Python 2:
	
	```text
	cd $MODDABLE/build/bin/wasm/debug/balls
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer
	```
	
	If you are using Python 3:
	
	```text
	cd $MODDABLE/build/bin/wasm/debug/balls
	python3 -m http.server
	```
	
	Go to [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser. You should see a web page with a simulator running `balls`.

## Linux

1. Clone the [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) repository into your `~/Projects` directory and activate the latest version.

	```text
	cd ~/Projects
	git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
	cd emsdk
	./emsdk install latest
	./emsdk activate latest
	```
	
	If you already have the Emscripten repository, upgrade to the latest version using the following commands:
	
	```text
	cd ~/Projects/emsdk
	git pull
	./emsdk install latest
	./emsdk activate latest
	```
	
	> We last tested using version 2.0.4 (commit `88b4ec65923815c3077e3637eefb54ab272d2646`).
		
2. Clone the [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) repository into your `~/Projects` directory and build it.

	```text
	cd ~/Projects
	git clone https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen.git
	cd binaryen
	cmake . && make
	```
	
	> We last tested using wasm-opt version 96 (commit `a96e8310e1a58c0a43b2d0e2ff4f9db24dd9a18a`)	
3. 	Setup the `PATH` and other environment variables by pasting the following commands into your `~/.bashrc`. The first command sources a shell script that sets environment variables for Emscripten. The second updates your `PATH` to include BinaryEn.

	```text
	source ~/Projects/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
	export PATH=~/Projects/binaryen/bin:$PATH
	```

	> Note: You must open a new shell instance or manually run the export statements in your shell before proceeding. Adding the export statements to your `~/.profile` does not update the environment variables in active shell instances.
