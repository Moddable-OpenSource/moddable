This document provides an introduction to getting started building apps with the Moddable SDK. It describes how to configure the host build environments, install the required SDKs, drivers and development tools, build applications, and use xsbug, the JavaScript source code debugger.

## macOS

### Host environment setup

> The Moddable SDK requires macOS Sierra version 10.12 or newer and Xcode version 9 or newer.

1. Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Launch Xcode to install additional command line components when prompted. 

2. Download the [Moddable repository] (https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable), or use the `git` command line tool as follows:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable
	```

3. Setup the `MODDABLE` environment variable to point at your local Moddable SDK repository directory and edit the `PATH` environment variable in your `~/.profile` to include the build directory:

	```
	export MODDABLE="/Users/<user>/Projects/moddable"
	export PATH="${MODDABLE}/build/bin/mac/release:$PATH"
	```
	
4. Build the Moddable command line tools, simulator, and debugger from the command line:

	```
	cd ${MODDABLE}/build/makefiles/mac
	make
	```
	
5. Launch the `xsbug` debugger from the command line:

	```
	open ${MODDABLE}/build/bin/mac/release/xsbug.app
	```

6. Verify the host environment setup by building the starter `helloworld` application for the desktop simulator target:

	```
	cd ${MODDABLE}/examples/helloworld
	mcconfig -d -m -p mac
	```
 
### ESP8266 (Moddable Zero) setup

## Debugging applications
The `xsbug` JavaScript source level debugger is built as part of the Moddable SDK build described above. `xsbug` is a full featured debugger that supports debugging modules and applications for [XS platforms](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/master/documentation/xs/XS%20Platforms.md). The `xsbug` debugger is automatically launched when deploying debug builds and connects to devices via USB or over Wi-Fi. Similar to other debuggers, `xsbug` supports setting breakpoints, browsing source code, the call stack and variables. The `xsbug` debugger additionally provides real-time instrumentation to track memory usage and profile application and resource consumption.

> For additional details on `xsbug` please refer to the [notes.md](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/blob/master/xs6/xsbug6/doc/notes.md) document in the [KinomaJS](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs) open source repository.
