/*
    This file implements a x-cli-lin platform for Moddable that supports an event loop and dynamically loaded
    archives (mods).  It implements the C main function, and starts up GTK with an invisible window to run
	the actual program.  It manages clearn termination upon receipt of ^C, and performs instrumentaton updates
	once/second.

	This code is built upon GTK3 because the core of the Moddable "lin" platform is built upon GTK.  This means
	that this "cli" application will not work on SSH or headless Linux without installing X and likely using
	xvfb (x frame buffer).
