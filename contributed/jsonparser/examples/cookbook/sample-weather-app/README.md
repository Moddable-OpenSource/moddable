## JSONParser Sample-Weather-App Cookbook Example

This example uses the Request class to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve weather data for a zip code in the United States. The response is parsed using the JSONParser class, which extracts specific values from the JSON data stream based on their keys. The extracted values are then displayed in the console.

### Run Sample App

```text
The temperature in Menlo Park is 60.82 F.
The weather condition is Clear.
```

> **Note**: The API response reflects real-time variations in temperature and conditions.
