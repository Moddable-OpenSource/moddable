This directory contains documents related to licensing.

> **Note**: Software licenses are complicated. Consult with legal counsel to understand how these licenses apply to your situation.

The license or licenses that apply to a given file are noted at the top of each source code file. In the absence of a specific license, no license is implied.

### GPL 3.0 and LGPL 3.0
The majority of software in the Moddable SDK is provided under the GPL 3.0 or LGPL 3.0. The text of these licenses is provided in [`gpl-3.0.txt`](gpl-3.0.txt) and [`lgpl-3.0.txt`](lgpl-3.0.txt).

As a general rule, software for build tools is licensed under GPL 3.0 and runtime software is licensed under LGPL 3.0.

The GPL 3.0 and LGPL 3.0 give product developers and product users very broad rights. We believe this is good for everyone. We also recognize that because of the far reaching freedoms granted by these licenses, not all developers are yet able or willing to use code carrying these licenses in their products. For these situations, Moddable also offers a conventional commercial software license for the Moddable SDK.

### Creative Commons
The example code in the Moddable SDK is provided under the Creative Commons [Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

### Apache 2.0
Some of the software in the Moddable SDK, primarily that related to the XS JavaScript engine, is derived from work done by the Kinoma team as an independent company and part of Marvell Semiconductor. XS is licensed by Marvell under the Apache 2.0 license. Files that carry the Apache license from Marvell and have since been modified as part of the Moddable SDK carry both the GPL 3.0 (or LGPL 3.0) license and the original Apache license.

The [`license/NOTICE`](NOTICE) file contains the license grant by Marvell Semiconductor, from the [KinomaJS](https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs/) repository on GitHub.

### SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1
Some of the fonts in the Moddable SDK are provided under the SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 license. The text of this license is provided in [OFL.txt](./OFT.txt).

### Contributor License Agreement
Moddable welcomes third party contributions to the Moddable SDK. Before we can accept a change, we ask that you complete a Contributor License Agreement. This ensures all users of the Moddable SDK that you have the right to make the contribution, and that they can continue to use the Moddable SDK with your changes under the existing licenses. The contributor license agreements are in the files [Moddable CLA - individual.pdf](Moddable%20CLA%20-%20individual.pdf) and [Moddable CLA - corporate.pdf](Moddable%20CLA%20-%20corporate.pdf).

The Moddable CLAs are based on the [individual](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) and [corporate](https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.pdf) Apache CLAs, which are also used by [Google](https://cla.developers.google.com/about).
